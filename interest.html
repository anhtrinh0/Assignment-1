      My interests:
    </h1>
    <p>
      I have had an interest in IT since I was a kid, which is why I’ve chosen to do the bachelor of IT here. In my daily life, I find myself using a lot of technology, phone, computer, even the Samsung smart fridge, and it really got me intrigued, wondering how they were programmed and become what we use right now. Regardless, these technologies made my life a lot easier. When I was born, technology advancement in my country is delayed compared to first world countries, so the 2000s in Vietnam is like the 1990s in Australia, so my hobbies would be watching a lot of stuff on TV. And during those times, I would watch those crazy sci-fi movies like ‘Back to the future’ that may not accurately depict what time travel is like but give me hope about what was possible that technology can bring us. Playing old-timer games like Contra and moving to Pokemon really showed me the unlimited possibilities that technology can create.

      Where it started:
    </h1>
    <p>
      Building on my childhood obsession with sci-fi movies and games, when I was 10, I received my first phone, which is a Nokia 1280 that is black and white, where I can only text, call and play basic games like Snake. And now I have a smartphone that can do many tasks, I can play music and play games and have a chat with friends all at the same time. This truly amazed me, and that was when I realized my interest in IT was real. And a plus, when I was given the choice to choose my career path during VCE, and like many people my age, I didn’t know what to choose, so I picked IT. Just so it happens that my IT teacher is a huge geek, and he has a lot of knowledge on computers on top of being a cool guy in general, and it really inspired me to work in IT related field in the future, so I can be like him.

      IT experience:
    </h1>
    <p>
      Prior to learning software development, I didn’t have too much IT experience, although I have watched tutorials on YouTube on some different topics (Linus Tech tip). I have also watched various tutorials on coding topics (mainly on c# and XML files for my high school subject). I also built my PC with a friend’s help back in 2019 (buying all the parts on sale before scalpers get to it) and it’s been my little war machine since then.  One time, I learned how to mod my 3ds through the drawing app to install homebrew as Nintendo doesn’t allow the modification of their hardware and download custom themes (don’t sue me Nintendo).

    <h1>
      Why i chose RMIT:
    </h1>
    <p>
      I chose RMIT because when it comes to studying IT, it is the first thing that comes to my mind. It is also located at a convenient location in the city, which helps me with my commutes and enables for after study relaxation with friends. The Uni also has amazing facilities that enable me to study more efficiently, but it is confusing to get to some buildings (like how building 8&10 are next to each other and have the same entrance). Another reason is that some of my friends who are doing the same course here recommended it to me, it is always nice to study with friends you’ve known for a long time, and I got to say, I am not disappointed.

    </p>
    <h1>
      What is expected to learn during my study:
    </h1>
    <p>
      During my study, I expect to learn more about programming languages (as I’ve learned C# in high school), but I would like to learn more about the more popular languages like Python and JavaScript to improve my knowledge in coding languages. I also would like to learn more about pretty much what we will cover in the course (cloud computing and A.I) that will hopefully help me to develop in the future and get into the career that I want.
