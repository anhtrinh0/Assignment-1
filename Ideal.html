    <p>
      Currently, I have had some experience in coding with modern languages, such as C# in high school and currently learning Python at RMIT. I haven’t had any experience with designing and architecture on the current system, as well as no experience as a software developer yet.

    <p>
      Over my next few years at Uni, I aim to obtain and develop a higher understanding and become efficient at using modern programming languages like python, Java…, I will also be looking at choosing electives in my next few years to gain experience in architecture and designing system, as well as making the best of some of my classes to get more experiences in working with databases… I will also be trying to get an internship at an IT company to gain experience. After I finish Uni, I expect to try and get a job in an IT-related field, gaining experiences as I go and jump between companies to advance my career and eventually build up enough experiences to work in a job like the one I've chosen.
