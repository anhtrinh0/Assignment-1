        Project Idea

      <h1>
        Overview:
      </h1>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h1>
        Motivation:
      </h1>
      <p>
        More than 3 million Australians live alone in their household, and this statistic is even higher for young people. Humans are social creatures, and we crave interaction from others (or simply, most people do not want to be alone). Australia is one of the most multicultural countries in the world, as we have people from so many diverse backgrounds. The new dating app would allow users to filter certain ethnicities of partners they’d like to see (putting their preferences for culture, race …) so they can match with other users with similar backgrounds or users from a different culture. If you’re part of the Gen Z generation like me, millennial, or even older, there’s a high chance that you’ve used Tinder or heard of it, and if you have, you will understand how hard it is to find a partner on this app. The dating app will hopefully solve the issues with popular dating apps and create a better dating environment for those having trouble finding a partner.
      </p>

        Description:
      </h1>
      <p>
        The first of any dating app, the user profile is one of the most important aspects of the app. It will contain the user’s basic information: Name, Age, Gender, Location, Photos, Interests, and options for the user to include a few catchphrases that will spark interest from other potential matches. The distinct feature of this app is that it will have the option (and it is encouraged to) to display their race/culture along with their preferred ethnicities/culture.
        One of the major issues with current popular dating apps is that it is usually filled with bot profiles to waste the time of users and collect their data. The app will have an option for users to link their social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter… via API) to their profile to prove that they are real. Other users can filter their matches to only users with linked profiles to reassure them that they are interacting with a real person.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app will have an algorithm that matches users based on their preferences. The user can set their preferences such as looking for a male/female/other partners, looking for someone with the same background as them or someone from a different culture, and other users who share the same interests. The algorithm will attempt to match based on those criteria in order, if the first criteria are met, it will proceed to the next one to help users find their ideal partner. The users can also set additional photos as private and can be revealed once they have matched and have liked each other's photos (which will be noted to the user).
      </p>
      <p>
        Once matched, users will have the choice to prompt a conversation in the next 48 hours (as many do not want to be seen as ‘desperate’ for instant messaging). It will remind users every 24 hours of their match, if possible, it will be prompted when the user is relaxed at home based on their set location to get user attention at their primetime. If the user has trouble starting a conversation, the app will display ice-breaker-styled prompts to help them initiate a conversation with their matched date. This is where an AI comes in, as it will assist the user with certain prompts to help them avoid being generic.
        The messaging section will also have a built-in minigame. Both users will have an option to invite the other person to one of the minigames, where both will be working together to win. These games are intended to help engage users who have matched and help them verify the authenticity of their matched date (reassuring it is not a bot). As this is a mobile app, the games will be highly interactive as an attempt to engage users together.
