      Background Information:
    </h1>
      <p>
        I’m originally from the Northern part of Vietnam, having moved to Australia in 2015. At the time of my transfer, I have to attend an English Language school before enrolling at an Australian Highschool, it was there that I met one of my best friend that I still hang out with now. I’ve just finished year 12 at Braybrook College last year and I’m currently doing my first year of Bachelor of Information Technology here at RMIT. As I was born and raised in Vietnam, I am bilingual, able to speak Vietnamese and English fluently(hopefully), I learned a little bit of Japanese during my high school years, but all I can remember now is how to count from 1 – 10 and how to say ‘good morning’. Like most people, I have a part-time job while attending Uni, working in the retail industry, and it made me hate people more than ever. Angry customer in retail = not fun time.

        Interests:
      </h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy watching comedy TV shows, such as The Office and Rick and Morty, at least once a week. On the weekends, I play badminton with my friends at our local badminton center, or computer games whenever I have the chance. Recently, I have been absorbed in the new Fromsoftware game Elden ring, which cuts off my connections to other people whenever I’m getting destroyed in the game.
        I also have a dying passion for collecting figures (where most of my money goes), particularly marvel and anime figures. It started when I found a cheap bootleg Darth Vader figure off Facebook marketplace, and I was hooked until now, where I have a collection of various series. I also cannot stand being bored, and I will constantly find something to do to satisfy my thirst for dopamine, let it be doing house chores or eating.

        I also have a little tabby cat called Lulu. She is about a year and a half now, and I’m too afraid to give her a shower bath because I might die of laceration, but I just love her to bits. One time, I let her sleep in my room and she ends up vomiting on my bed so I have to take her to the VET at 7 am the next morning, definitely don’t regret having a cat.
